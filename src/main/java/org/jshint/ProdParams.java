/**
 * This module defines a set of enum-like values intended for use as bit
 * "flags" during parsing. The ECMAScript grammar defines a number of such
 * "production parameters" to control how certain forms are parsed in context.
 * JSHint implements additional parameters to facilitate detection of lint
 * warnings.
 *
 * An equivalent implementation which described the context in terms of a
 * "lookup table" object would be more idiomatic for a JavaScript project like
 * JSHint. However, because the number of contexts scales with the number of
 * expressions in the input program, this would have non-negligible impact on
 * the process's memory footprint.
